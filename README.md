# Ngraph
wip Nmap helper that can store and query nmap scans using arangodb.

I've been building this on and off while studying for my OSCP. 
This tool is in an early development stage. 
Currently graph algorithms aren't being used.

Depending on how useful this turns out to be, I may pursue a native graph API 
over locking into arangodb.
